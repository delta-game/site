> Right now we're linking to the more-or-less offsite (Github hosted) versions of these. Ideally, I'd like to figure a way where these will be hosted on-site via some shortcode wizardry (and maybe some JS). I think I'm going to have to have it automagically translate the markdown file from the 'raw' "githubusercontent.com" url to a local html file on-the-fly and probably redirect any links it finds to use the /meta folder as the new top-level directory. But idk, just kinda tossing ideas around (ie: haven't actually looked into it all) lol.
